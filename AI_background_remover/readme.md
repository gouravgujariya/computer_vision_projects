# I have asked chatgpt to behave as my manager and provide me with task and help me complete this so lets get started
Alright, let's break it down into structured tasks and cycles so you can complete the project by Sunday. Since you have **2 hours per day**, we'll focus on daily achievable milestones.  

---

## **ðŸ“… Project Timeline (March 4 - March 10)**  

### **ðŸ”¹ Day 1 (Tuesday, March 5) - Research & Setup**  
âœ… Research DeepLabV3 & HRNet implementation in OpenCV  
âœ… Set up Colab environment & test DeepLabV3 on sample images  
âœ… Create a GitHub repo for version control  
âœ… Install dependencies and document the setup process  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Day 2 (Wednesday, March 6) - Preprocessing & Edge Detection**  
âœ… Implement image preprocessing with OpenCV (e.g., resizing, blurring)  
âœ… Add edge detection (Canny/other filters for better segmentation)  
âœ… Test preprocessing pipeline on various images  
âœ… Save intermediary results for debugging  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Day 3 (Thursday, March 7) - Background Segmentation Model**  
âœ… Load DeepLabV3 model & integrate it with the preprocessing pipeline  
âœ… Implement background segmentation (extract foreground mask)  
âœ… Test with different backgrounds & refine mask quality  
âœ… Optimize model for performance  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Day 4 (Friday, March 8) - Django Web App Development**  
âœ… Set up Django project & create basic UI for file upload  
âœ… Integrate model with Django backend (handle image processing)  
âœ… Implement image upload & display results after processing  
âœ… Debug & ensure smooth processing flow  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Day 5 (Saturday, March 9) - Enhancements & Deployment**  
âœ… Implement video support for background removal  
âœ… Optimize real-time processing (reduce latency)  
âœ… Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces & GitHub  
âœ… Write clear README with instructions & demo  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Day 6 (Sunday, March 10) - Final Testing & Showcase**  
âœ… Test everything end-to-end (both image & video support)  
âœ… Fix any last-minute issues & improve UI if needed  
âœ… Record a short demo video & post on LinkedIn/GitHub  
âœ… Write project description & submit  

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Additional Notes:**  
- **Daily Deliverables:** Push code to GitHub every day.  
- **Colab Compatibility:** Ensure everything runs in Colab.  
- **Sunday Deadline:** The project should be fully working & deployed.  

ðŸ”¥ **Let's get started! Stick to the plan, and youâ€™ll have a polished project by Sunday!** ðŸš€
