Here's a structured project plan designed for **CPU-only** implementation using **BRIA RMBG** for AI-based background removal:

---

## **ðŸ“… Project Timeline (March 4 - March 10) â€“ CPU-Based BRIA RMBG Implementation**

| **Day** | **Tasks** | **Details** |
|:---------|:------------|:------------------------|
| **ðŸ”¹ Day 1 (Tuesday, March 5)** | **Research & Setup** | âœ… Research BRIA RMBG implementation for background removal using CPU.  <br>âœ… Set up a Colab environment ensuring CPU compatibility.  <br>âœ… Install required dependencies and document the setup process. |
| **ðŸ”¹ Day 2 (Wednesday, March 6)** | **Preprocessing Pipeline** | âœ… Implement image and video preprocessing using OpenCV.  <br>âœ… Include resizing, color correction, and blurring techniques for better segmentation.  <br>âœ… Save intermediary results for easier debugging. |
| **ðŸ”¹ Day 3 (Thursday, March 7)** | **Background Removal Integration** | âœ… Integrate the BRIA RMBG model with the preprocessing pipeline.  <br>âœ… Develop a function to handle both **image** and **video** background removal.  <br>âœ… Test background removal on sample files to ensure performance on CPU. |
| **ðŸ”¹ Day 4 (Friday, March 8)** | **Django Web App Development** | âœ… Set up a Django project with file upload functionality.  <br>âœ… Integrate BRIA RMBG for background removal on uploaded images/videos.  <br>âœ… Implement UI to display results clearly. |
| **ðŸ”¹ Day 5 (Saturday, March 9)** | **Enhancements & Deployment** | âœ… Add optimization for CPU performance (e.g., batch processing for videos).  <br>âœ… Improve UI for better user experience.  <br>âœ… Deploy on **Hugging Face Spaces** and push code to **GitHub**. |
| **ðŸ”¹ Day 6 (Sunday, March 10)** | **Final Testing & Showcase** | âœ… Conduct thorough testing to ensure stability.  <br>âœ… Record a short demo showcasing the tool in action.  <br>âœ… Write a clear README with instructions and usage details. |

## **âœ… Key Focus for CPU Optimization**
- Use **BRIA RMBG** with batch processing for efficient video frame handling.
- Implement efficient image resizing to reduce computational load.
- Avoid using large models like DeepLabV3; focus on **lighter architectures** optimized for CPU.
- For better performance, consider:
  - Converting PIL images to NumPy arrays for faster manipulation.
  - Using multiprocessing for parallel frame processing in video files.

## **ðŸ“Œ Additional Notes**
- **Daily Deliverables:** Push code to GitHub daily.
- **User Experience Focus:** Ensure UI is intuitive and smooth on CPU devices.
- **Sunday Deadline:** The project should be fully functional and ready for showcase.

ðŸ”¥ **Stay focused, and this plan will guide you to complete a CPU-efficient background removal tool by Sunday!** ðŸš€
