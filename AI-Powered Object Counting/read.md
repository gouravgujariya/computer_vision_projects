## **ðŸ“… Project Timeline (March 4 - March 10) â€“ CPU-Based Object Counting System**

| **Day** | **Tasks** | **Details** |
|:---------|:------------|:------------------------|
| **ðŸ”¹ Day 1 (Tuesday, March 5)** | **Research & Setup** | âœ… Research lightweight object detection models optimized for CPU (e.g., **YOLOv8n**, **MobileNet SSD**, or **YOLOv5n**).<br>âœ… Set up a development environment with OpenCV, Torch, and dependencies.<br>âœ… Create a **GitHub repo** for version control.<br>âœ… Install dependencies and document the setup process. |
| **ðŸ”¹ Day 2 (Wednesday, March 6)** | **Camera Integration & Preprocessing** | âœ… Implement CCTV camera input integration using OpenCV.<br>âœ… Add preprocessing techniques for improving detection accuracy (e.g., resizing, frame stabilization, and noise reduction).<br>âœ… Test the camera feed with real-time visualization. |
| **ðŸ”¹ Day 3 (Thursday, March 7)** | **Object Detection Integration** | âœ… Load a lightweight YOLO model (e.g., **YOLOv8n**) optimized for CPU.<br>âœ… Implement object counting logic (e.g., counting objects entering or exiting a defined region).<br>âœ… Visualize object detection with bounding boxes and labels. |
| **ðŸ”¹ Day 4 (Friday, March 8)** | **Counting Logic & Performance Optimization** | âœ… Add logic for tracking objects across frames to maintain accurate counting.<br>âœ… Implement techniques to reduce CPU load (e.g., frame skipping, region-based detection).<br>âœ… Ensure smooth processing with minimal delay. |
| **ðŸ”¹ Day 5 (Saturday, March 9)** | **Django Web App Development & Deployment** | âœ… Develop a Django web app with video stream integration.<br>âœ… Display the CCTV feed alongside the object count in real time.<br>âœ… Deploy the application on **Hugging Face Spaces** and push code to **GitHub**. |
| **ðŸ”¹ Day 6 (Sunday, March 10)** | **Final Testing & Showcase** | âœ… Conduct comprehensive testing in various lighting conditions and crowded scenes.<br>âœ… Record a short demo showcasing the system in action.<br>âœ… Write a detailed README with setup instructions and feature highlights. |

## **âœ… Key Focus for CPU Optimization**
- Use **YOLOv8n** (nano) for its efficiency on CPU.  
- Implement **frame skipping** to reduce processing load while maintaining accuracy.  
- For optimal performance:  
  - Resize frames to **640x640** or smaller for faster inference.  
  - Use **integer quantization** or model pruning if needed for improved speed.  
  - Focus on reducing unnecessary computations (e.g., limiting detection zones).

## **ðŸ“Œ Additional Notes**
- **Daily Deliverables:** Push code to GitHub daily.  
- **User Experience Focus:** Ensure real-time counting works smoothly with clear visualization.  
- **Sunday Deadline:** The project should be stable, optimized for CPU, and ready for showcase.  

ðŸ”¥ **Follow the plan, and you'll have an efficient object counting system running on CPU by Sunday!** ðŸš€
